# Machine-Learning-in-Trading
Making trading decisions based on future price of stocks

An application file can be given as an input to train most optimal Machine Learning model to learn the behaviour of that application.
Then the trained model can be used to predice target value for given input features.

Specfic feature-This web application can be used for any kind of application like chemical problem,trading problem etc.
Here I have taken trading problem to train my model to predict future price of stock data.
Various ML models are trained for input application file and then the one with maximum accuracy is chosen to perform the task.
Technology used:
1.Django Framework
2.Python libraries-pandas,matplotlib,pyplot
3.ML models-Linear regression, Lasso Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge Regression, KNN, SVM , Logistic Regression
